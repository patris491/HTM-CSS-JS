            <p><h1><b>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b></h1></p>
                <p><em> Ipsum is simply</em> text of the printing and typesetting industry. <mark> Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the<b>1500s</b></mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <b>1960s</b> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>.</p>

                <p><h1>Why do we use it?</h1></p>

            <p> is a long <sub>established</sub> fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <sup>Lorem Ipsum</sup> as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <ins>(injected humour and the like)</ins>.</p>
